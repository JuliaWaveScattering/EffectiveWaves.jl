Theoretically, the tomographic data are obtained at the zeroth approximation of geometrical optics for Man’s residual stress model. For compressional waves, the inverse problem is equivalent to the problem of inverting the longitudinal ray transform of a symmetric tensor field. For shear waves, the inverse problem, after the linearization, leads to another integral geometry operator which is called the mixed ray transform. Under some restrictions on coefficients, we are able to prove the uniqueness results in these two cases.},

	abstract = {. In this paper we covariantly obtain all the governing equations of linearized elasticity. Our motivation is to see if one can make a connection between invariance (covariance) properties of the (global) balance of energy in nonlinear elasticity and those of its counterpart in linear elasticity. We start by proving a Green-Naghdi-Rivilin theorem for linearized elasticity. We do this by first linearizing energy balance about a given reference motion and then by postulating its invariance under isometries of the Euclidean ambient space. We also investigate the possibility of covariantly deriving a linearized elasticity theory, without any reference to the local governing equations, e.g. local balance of linear momentum. In particular, we study the consequences of linearizing covariant energy balance and covariance of linearized energy balance. We show that in both cases, covariance gives all the field equations of linearized elasticity.},

	abstract = {This paper presents some developments related to the idea of covariance in elasticity. The geometric point of view in continuum mechanics is briefly reviewed. Building on this, regarding the reference configuration and the ambient space as Riemannian manifolds with their own metrics, a Lagrangian field theory of elastic bodies with evolving reference configurations is developed. It is shown that even in this general setting, the Euler-Lagrange equations resulting from horizontal (referential) variations are equivalent to those resulting from vertical (spatial) variations. The classical Green-Naghdi-Rivilin theorem is revisited and a material version of it is discussed. It is shown that energy balance, in general, cannot be invariant under isometries of the reference configuration, which in this case is identified with a subset of R 3 . Transformation properties of balance of energy under rigid translations and rotations of the reference configuration is obtained. The spatial covariant theory of elasticity is also revisited. The transformation of balance of energy under an arbitrary diffeomorphism of the reference configuration is obtained and it is shown that some nonstandard terms appear in the transformed balance of energy. Then conditions under which energy balance is materially covariant are obtained. It is seen that material covariance of energy balance is equivalent to conservation of mass, isotropy, material Doyle-Ericksen formula and an extra condition that we call configurational inviscidity. In the last part of the paper, the connection between Noether’s theorem and covariance is investigated. It is shown that the Doyle-Ericksen formula can be obtained as a consequence of spatial covariance of Lagrangian density. Similarly, it is shown that the material Doyle-Ericksen formula can be obtained from material covariance of Lagrangian density.},

	abstract = {The effects of applied cyclic tensional deformation and relaxation on cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells were examined. Endothelial cells from passages 3 to 9 were seeded in flexible-bottomed plates and allowed to attach for 24 hours. Endothelial cells in the experimental group (n = 6 wells per time point) were placed in a vacuum-operated stress-providing instrument that exerted an average elongation of 10\% at maximum downward deflection of the culture plate bottom. The stretched endothelial cells were subjected to repeating cycles of 10 seconds elongation and 10 seconds relaxation from days 1 through 7 in culture. Endothelial cells in the control group (n = 6 wells per time point) were subjected to similar incubation conditions as the experimental group but without tensional deformation. Tritiated thymidine was added to cells 24 hours before harvesting. On days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 cells were counted and analyzed for trichloroacetic acid-precipitable tritiated thymidine incorporation. The results showed that 3 cycles/min mechanical stretching stimulated deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis and endothelial cell division. We conclude that cyclic tensional deformation may stimulate endothelial cell proliferation. It is possible that naturally occurring cyclic mechanical deformation in vivo, such as the repetitive stretching and relaxation of aortic tissue by the heart, may invoke a particular pattern of synthesis and division in endothelial cells.

	abstract = {Despite its fundamental role in the dynamics of compressible fluids, bulk viscosity has received little experimental attention and there remains a paucity of measured data. Acoustic spectroscopy provides a robust and accurate approach to measuring this parameter. Working from the Navier-Stokes model of a compressible fluid one can show that the bulk viscosity makes a significant and measurable contribution to the frequency-squared acoustic attenuation. Here we employ this methodology to determine the bulk viscosity of Millipore water over a temperature range of 7 to 50 degrees Celsius. The measured attenuation spectra are consistent with the theoretical predictions, while the bulk viscosity of water is found to be approximately three times larger than its shear counterpart, reinforcing its significance in acoustic propagation. Moreover, our results demonstrate that this technique can be readily and generally applied to fluids to accurately determine their temperature dependent bulk viscosities.},

The problems are carried as far as possible analytically without approximations and are reported as matrix equations. The solution of these equations yields the expansion coefficients that describe the waves which are scattered outward from the obstacle and which are excited within the scatterer. A general expression for the scattering cross section offered to a transverse wave has been derived. The Rayleigh approximation is then considered in detail for three of the cases.},

	abstract = {Elevated temperatures and extreme temperature gradients arise in a large variety of engineering problems, and often produced thermal stresses and thermal deformations that crucially affect the life of the materials and the systems involved. Early examples arose with the advent of high-speed rocket-powered flight and the development of nuclear energy sources. More recent applications can be found in fields ranging from reentry heating and ablation in space flight to the localized heat generation in computer chips, produced by high temperature during fabrication and by high current density during service.This highly regarded text, aimed both at the researcher and the practicing engineer, as well as the student, presents a detailed discussion of fundamental aspects of the theory, accompanied by detailed solutions of typical and illustrative problems. The book is divided into four parts: Part I develops the fundamentals of thermoelasticity, starting with a presentation of the thermodynamic foundations of the subject and leading to various alternate formulations and methods of solutions of thermoelastic problems. Part {II} discusses the physical basis of heat transfer theory and methods of solution of heat conduction boundary-value problems. Part {III} covers more practical aspects of thermal stress analysis, mainly from the strength-of-materials viewpoint. Finally, Part {IV} presents the manner in which temperature effects can be included in inelasticity theory.The result is an extremely useful resource which presents the salient features of the subject in a single volume from a unified and basic theoretical point of view.},

The equation is believed to have universal applicability, and should be equally valid for foams, although the values of the numerical constants may depend slightly on the drop size distribution and the thickness of the aqueous films between the droplets. Older theories for the limiting case of φ ≈ 1 overpredict the modulus by a factor of exactly, or close to, 2. The source of this error may be traced to the underlying model, which does not meet the condition of mechanical equilibrium at the lines of intersection of the interdroplet films as the network is strained.},

	abstract = {Thermodynamic restrictions of elastic materials in general are well-known based on the Clausius–Duhem inequality by employing the simple Coleman–Noll procedure. One of the basic assumptions in this entropy inequality is that the entropy flux is defined as the heat flux divided by the absolute temperature. To avoid this unnecessary and possibly too restrictive assumption, the general entropy inequality has been proposed and its thermodynamic consequences exploited following the Müller–Liu procedure in which supply-free bodies are considered and Lagrange Multipliers are introduced. In this new thermodynamic theory, the entropy flux and heat flux relation identical to the above assumption has not been proved for elastic bodies in general. For isotropic elastic bodies, it was proved by Müller in 1971, using explicit isotropic representations for constitutive functions. Unfortunately, the procedure contains a flaw which was later pointed out, but can not be easily resolved. Although it was shown later that it can be proved by Müller–Liu procedure, it has not been available in the literature. In this paper, we shall establish this result, providing the missing details in the previous proof. The analysis will be carried out for isotropic viscoelastic materials and the case of elastic materials follows as a special case.},

	abstract = {Greek and Roman philosophers had conceived of atoms, and they developed the idea in more detail than we are usually led to believe. In the thinking of Leukippus and Demokritus in the 5th and 4th century B.C., the atoms of air move in all directions, and only occasionally they change their paths when they hit each other. To the ancients this fairly modern view implied a kind of determinism, which was incompatible with the idea of God, or gods, playing out their pranks, benevolent or otherwise. Therefore in later times, in the hands of Epicurus (341–270 B.C.) and Lucretius (95–55 B.C.), the atomistic philosophy of the “Natura Rerum” - this is the title of Lucretius’s long poem - adopted an anti-religious and even atheistic flavour, which rendered it politically and socially unacceptable. Therefore atomism faded away, and in the end it came to represent no more than a footnote in ancient philosophy.},

Young used it as a convenient abbreviation for the sum of kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy of a mass and the elastic energy of a spring to which the mass may be attached. That sum is conserved by Newton’s laws and Hooke’s law of elasticity, although the individual contributions might change.1 The term energy was not fully accepted until the second half of the 19th century when it was extrapolated away from mechanics to include the internal energy of thermodynamics and the electro-magnetic energy. The first law of thermodynamics states that the total sum is conserved: the sum of mechanical, thermodynamic, electromagnetic, and nuclear energies. We shall proceed to describe the difficult birth of that idea.},

Similarly, natural gas and mineral oil must be refined before use, and ore must be smelted down in the smelting furnace. Smelting was, of course, known to the ancients - although it was not always done efficiently - and so was distillation of sea water which provided both, sweet water and pure salt in one step, the former after re-condensation. Actually, in ancient times there was perhaps less scarcity of sweet water than today, but - just like today - there was a large demand for hard liquor that had to be distilled from wine, or from other fermented fruit or vegetable juices.},

	abstract = {Generalized dynamic thermoelasticity is a vital area of research in continuum mechanics, free of the classical paradox of infinite propagation speeds of thermal signals in Fourier-type heat conduction. Besides that paradox, the classical dynamic thermoelasticity theory offers either unsatisfactory or poor descriptions of a solid's response at low temperatures or to a fast transient loading (say, due to short laser pulses). Several models have been developed and intensively studied over the past four decades, yet this book, which aims to provide a point of reference in the field, is the first monograph on the subject since the 1970s. Thermoelasticity with Finite Wave Speeds focuses on dynamic thermoelasticity governed by hyperbolic equations, and, in particular, on the two leading theories: that of Lord-Shulman (with one relaxation time), and that of Green-Lindsay (with two relaxation times). While the resulting field equations are linear partial differential ones, the complexity of the theories is due to the coupling of mechanical with thermal fields. The mathematical aspects of both theories - existence and uniqueness theorems, domain of influence theorems, convolutional variational principles - as well as the methods for various initial/boundary value problems are explained and illustrated in detail and several applications of generalized thermoelasticity are reviewed.},

However, subsequent investigators of liquid systems have generally neglected the thermal transport process. We show in this work that the Epstein‐Carhart results provide a good description of our experimental attenuation data in emulsions, and that the thermal transport process can be the major factor in the attenuation. We have here also extended the theory further to include the attenuation in suspensions of solid particles, and good agreement is found between our theory and experimental results for aqueous suspensions of polystyrene spheres.},

	abstract = {In physics, the Navier–Stokes equations /nævˈjeɪ stoʊks/, named after Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes, describe the motion of viscous fluid substances. These balance equations arise from applying Newton's second law to fluid motion, together with the assumption that the stress in the fluid is the sum of a diffusing viscous term (proportional to the gradient of velocity) and a pressure term—hence describing viscous flow. The main difference between them and the simpler Euler equations for inviscid flow is that Navier–Stokes equations also in the Froude limit (no external field) are not conservation equations, but rather a dissipative system, in the sense that they cannot be put into the quasilinear homogeneous form:

Navier–Stokes equations are useful because they describe the physics of many phenomena of scientific and engineering interest. They may be used to model the weather, ocean currents, water flow in a pipe and air flow around a wing. The Navier–Stokes equations in their full and simplified forms help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow, the design of power stations, the analysis of pollution, and many other things. Coupled with Maxwell's equations they can be used to model and study magnetohydrodynamics.
The Navier–Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense. Somewhat surprisingly, given their wide range of practical uses, it has not yet been proven that in three dimensions solutions always exist, or that if they do exist, then they are smooth, i.e. they do not contain any Mathematical singularity. These are called the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problems. The Clay Mathematics Institute has called this one of the seven most important open problems in mathematics and has offered a {US}\$1,000,000 prize for a solution or a counter-example.},

	abstract = {Residual stress due to shrinkage of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement after polymerisation is possibly one factor capable of initiating cracks in the mantle of cemented hip replacements. No relationship between residual stress and observed cracking of cement has yet been demonstrated. To investigate if any relationship exists, a physical model has been developed which allows direct observation of damage in the cement layer on the femoral side of total hip replacement. The model contains medial and lateral cement layers between a bony surface and a metal stem; the tubular nature of the cement mantle is ignored. Five specimens were prepared and examined for cracking using manual tracing of stained cracks, observed by transmission microscopy; cracks were located and measured using image analysis. A mathematical approach for the prediction of residual stress due to shrinkage was developed which uses the thermal history of the material to predict when stress-locking occurs, and estimates subsequent thermal stress. The residual stress distribution of the cement layer in the physical model was then calculated using finite element analysis. Results show maximum tensile stresses normal to the observed crack directions, suggesting a link between residual stress and pre-load cracking. The residual stress predicted depends strongly on the definition of the reference temperature for stress-locking. The highest residual stresses (4-7 {MPa}) are predicted for shrinkage from maximum temperature; in this case, magnitudes are sufficiently high to initiate cracks when the influence of stress raisers such as pores or interdigitation at the bone/cement interface are taken into account (up to 24 {MPa} when calculating stress around a pore according to the method of Harrigan and Harris (J. Biomech. 24(11) (1991) 1047-1058). We conclude that the damage accumulation failure scenario begins before weight-bearing due to cracking induced by residual stress around pores or stress raisers.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the wall stresses in an abdominal aortic aneurysm ({AAA}) may be helpful in evaluating the need for surgical intervention to avoid rupture. This must be preceded by the development of a more suitable finite strain constitutive model for {AAA}, as none currently exists. Additionally, reliable stress analysis of in vivo {AAA} for the purposes of clinical diagnostics requires patient-specific values of the material parameters, which are difficult to determine noninvasively. The purpose of this work, therefore, was three-fold: (1) to develop a finite strain constitutive model for {AAA}; (2) to estimate the variation of model parameters within a sample population; and (3) to evaluate the sensitivity of computed stress distribution in {AAA} due to this biologic variation. We propose here a two parameter, hyperelastic, isotropic, incompressible material model and utilize experimental data from 69 freshly excised {AAA} specimens to both develop the functional form of the model and estimate its material parameters. Parametric analyses were performed via repeated finite element computations to determine the effect of varying each of the two model parameters on the stress distribution in a three-dimensional {AAA} model. The agreement between experimental data and the proposed functional form of the constitutive law was very good (R2\&gt;0.9). Our finite element simulations showed that the computed {AAA} wall stresses changed by only 4\% or less when both the parameters were varied within the 95\% confidence intervals for the patient population studied. This observation indicates that in lieu of the patient-specific material parameters, which are difficult to determine the use of population mean values is sufficiently accurate for the model to be reasonably employed in a clinical setting. We believe that this is an important advancement toward the development of a computational tool for the estimation of rupture potential for individual {AAA}, for which there is great clinical need.},

In contrast, we use a model which is simple and allows the prescription of any residual stress field.

We specialize the analysis to an elastic tube subject to a two-dimensional residual stress, and find that incremental wrinkles can appear on its inner or its outer face, depending on the location of the highest value of the residual hoop stress. We further validate the predictions of the incremental theory with finite element simulations, which allow us to go beyond this threshold and predict the shape, number and amplitude of the resulting creases.},

Here, both the half-space and the layer are assumed to be incompressible and initially stressed in their reference configuration. The initial stress in this problem is not associated with a finite elastic deformation which is in contrast to the situation where the initial stress is a pre-stress that is accompanied by a finite deformation. A general formulation of the equations governing incremental motions is provided, and then the specialized case of in-plane motions is considered. The theory of superposition of infinitesimal deformations on finite deformations is applied for initially-stressed incompressible materials. The principal plane of the underlying (homogeneous) deformation with a uniform initial stress is assumed to be coaxial with the finite deformation. With this specialization, the combined effect of initial stress and finite deformation on the speed of Love waves is discussed and the results are analyzed graphically with the main emphasis on the effect of initial stress on wave speed.},

With a suitable simple choice of constitutive law that includes initial stress, it is shown that in many cases, as is to be expected, the effect of a finite deformation (with an associated pre-stress) is very similar to that of an initial stress (without an accompanying finite deformation). However, by contrast, when the finite deformation and initial stress are considered together independently with a judicious choice of material parameters different features are found that do not appear in the separate finite deformation or initial stress situations on their own.},

The artery is assumed to be a thick-walled tube composed of an orthotropic pseudoelastic material. In addition, the normal mature vessel is assumed to have uniform circumferential wall stress, which is achieved here via a mechanical growth law. Residual stresses are computed for three configurations: the unloaded intact artery, the artery after a single transmural cut, and the inner and outer rings of the artery created by combined radial and circumferential cuts. The results show that the magnitudes of the opening angles depend strongly on the heterogeneity of the material properties of the vessel wall and that multiple radial and circumferential cuts may be needed to relieve all residual stress. In addition, comparing computed opening angles with published experimental data for the bovine carotid artery suggests that the material properties change continuously across the vessel wall and that stress, not strain, correlates well with growth in arteries.},

	abstract = {The research work included in this thesis concerns the study of wave propagation in elastic materials which are stressed in their initial state. This research is based on the non-linear theory of elasticity.

Using the theory of invariants, the general constitutive equation for an isotropic hyperelastic material in the presence of initial stress is derived. These invariants depend on the finite deformation as well as the initial stress. In general, this derivation involves 10 invariants for a compressible material and 9 for an incompressible material. Making use of these invariants, the elasticity tensor is given in its most general form for both the deformed and the undeformed (i.e., the initially stressed reference) configurations. The equations governing infinitesimal motions superimposed on a finite deformations are then used to study the effects of initial stress and finite deformation on wave propagation. For each of the problems carried out in this thesis, the results are specialized for a prototype strain energy function which depends on the initial stress as well as the deformation. The basic theory in each of the problems is formed for the material in the deformed configuration and is later specialized for the undeformed reference configuration. Considering the special case when initial stress is zero, the results are compared with those from the linear theory of elasticity.

The problem of homogeneous plane waves in an initially stressed incompressible half-space is considered. The basic theory of the problem is later used to study the reflection of plane waves from the boundary of such a half-space. The reflection coefficients of waves are calculated and graphical representations are given to study the behaviour with reference to the magnitude of initial stress and finite deformation.

The study of Rayleigh and Love waves follows thereafter and the basic theory already developed in this thesis is used to study the effect of initial stress on the wave speed of these surface waves. In both cases, the secular equation is analysed in deformed and undeformed configurations and graphs are presented.

The problem of wave propagation in a residually stressed  inhomogeneous thick-walled incompressible tube which is axially stretched and inflated due to internal pressure, is considered. On the basis of known experimental behaviour, a simple expression for the residual stress is chosen to calculate the internal pressure used to inflate the tube and the axial load to stretch it. The effect of initial stress and stretch on pressure and axial load is studied and graphs are presented. The general theory developed for the deformed configuration for the special model is specialized to the reference configuration and the dispersion relation is analysed numerically.},

A nonlinear inverse spectral technique is developed that makes fundamental use of the finite strain nonlinear response of the material to a quasi-static loading. The soft tissue is modeled as a nonlinear, prestressed and residually stressed, isotropic, slightly compressible elastic body with a rectangular geometry. A boundary value problem is formulated for the residually stressed and prestressed soft tissue, the boundary of which is subjected to a quasi-static pressure, and then an idealized model for the ultrasound interrogation is constructed by superimposing small amplitude time harmonic infinitesimal vibrations on static finite deformation via an asymptotic construction. The model is studied, through a semi-inverse approach, for a specific class of deformations that leads to a system of second order differential equations with homogeneous boundary conditions of Sturm–Liouville type. By making use of the classical theory of inverse Sturm–Liouville problems, and root finding and optimization techniques, several inverse spectral algorithms are developed to approximate the residual stress distribution in the body, given the first few eigenfrequencies of several induced static pressures.},

Then we further link this condition to the rank-one positive definiteness of three second-order tensors, three fourth-order tensors and a sixth-order tensor. In particular, we consider conditions of strong ellipticity of the rhombic classes, for which we need to check the copositivity of three second-order tensors and the positive definiteness of a sixth-order tensor. A direct method is presented to verify our conditions.},

	abstract = {A general methodology is proposed for the determination of surface residual stresses and residual plastic strains using instrumented sharp indentation. The residual stresses and the residual plastic strains are assumed to be equibiaxial and uniform over a depth (beneath the indented surface) which is at least several times larger than the indentation contact diameter. The indenter load and geometry can be so chosen as to minimize or maximize the contact radius to seek the broadest range of applicability and validity of the proposed method by recourse to macro-, micro- and nanoindentation of elastoplastic materials. Invoking the invariance of contact pressure in the presence of an elastic residual stress, or the change in the instantaneous yield strength of a strain-hardening elastoplastic solid in the presence of a residual plastic strain, a step-by-step method is outlined here to estimate pre-existing residual stress/strain fields. The technique can be directly used for residual stress measurements in such applications as thin films for microelectronics and optoelectronics, structural coatings, and engineered surfaces whose properties are altered by such methods as mechanical working, etching, ion implantation, case hardening, laser treatments, shot peening or laser shock peening. The predictions of the proposed analytical method for determining residual stresses have been shown to compare favorably with finite element predictions as well as available experimental results.},

A large class of inverse problems arise from a physical situation modeled by partial differential equations. The inverse problem is to determine some coefficients of the equation given some information about solutions. Analysis of such problems is a fertile area for interaction between pure and applied mathematics. This interplay is well represented in this volume where several theoretical and applied aspects of inverse problems are considered. The book includes articles on a broad range of inverse problems including the inverse conductivity problem, inverse problems for Maxwell's equations, time reversal mirrors, ultrasound using elastic pressure waves, inverse problems arising in the environment, inverse scattering for the three-body problem, and optical tomography. Also included are several articles on unique continuation and on the study of propagation of singularities for hyperbolic equations in anisotropic media.

The various specific methods have evolved over several decades and their practical applications have greatly benefited from the development of complementary technologies, notably in material cutting, full-field deformation measurement techniques, numerical methods and computing power. These complementary technologies have stimulated advances not only in measurement accuracy and reliability, but also in range of application; much greater detail in residual stresses measurement is now available. This paper aims to classify the different residual stresses measurement methods and to provide an overview of some of the recent advances in this area to help researchers on selecting their techniques among destructive, semi destructive and non-destructive techniques depends on their application and the availabilities of those techniques. For each method scope, physical limitation, advantages and disadvantages are summarized. In the end this paper indicates some promising directions for future developments.},

	abstract = {The application of acoustoelasticity using critically refracted longitudinal ({LCR}) waves is described for measuring residual stress in welded steel plates. Residual stresses are self-equilibrating and may exist in a material that has been deformed in a nonhomogeneous manner. When unknown residual stress is present in a structure, the true stress may become significantly greater than the working stress. In a corrosive environment, highly stressed areas that have not been properly stress relieved are prone to stress corrosion cracking. Areas near welds are particularly susceptible to stress corrosion cracking. Two welded plates were investigated for the present work: one hot-rolled and the other cold-rolled. Residual stresses are usually greatest after welding. Further, longitudinal stress (i.e., stress parallel to the weld bead) is typically greater than the component transverse to the weld bead. Since the acoustoelastic behavior of the {LCR} wave is largest when propagated parallel to a uniaxial stress, the {LCR} wave traveling parallel to the weld bead was used to investigate the stress changes after stress relieving of the welded plates. Both 1 {MHz} and 2.25 {MHz} probe frequencies were used in this study. The stress changes in the welds and in the cold-rolled plate were clearly indicated by the {LCR} data. Two verification methods were used: hole drilling ({HD}) and neutron diffraction ({ND}). The stress relief was verified by the hole-drilling technique. While the {HD} technique showed about the same stress magnitude as found by the {LCR} results, the orientation was reversed. The stress orientation was probably caused by the grinding process used to flatten the weld bead. Texture was also investigated using a neutron diffraction ({ND}) technique on the (001)[110] texture. The through-the-thickness technique yields an average of the orientation distribution of the (110) planes. At locations in the parent metal and in the weld, the distribution was found to be very similar, indicating uniform texture throughout the weld and parent metal zones.},

The proposed approach can be considered as base for a structures monitoring system. The analysis of the acoustoelastic effect for solid bodies, i.e., the correlation between the acoustic properties and the stress state, may be suitably exploited for experimental purposes. To this aim, relevant modeling and experimental issues should be overcome. Indeed, the usual theoretical framework of the acoustoelastic measurements is the so-called third-order elasticity, based on the use of the acoustoelastic coefficients, and requiring relatively simple experimental measurements. Here, by adopting an innovative ultrasonic setup, we investigate the capability of a theoretical model developed within the linearized elasticity, and used for describing the propagation of small amplitude waves in prestressed elastic materials. The results of the ultrasonic tests show that this approach in capable of accurate in situ stress measurements. The proposed experimental setup could be further investigated for monitoring applications of stress states in structures during their service life.},

	abstract = {In classical constitutive models such as the Navier-Stokes fluid model, and the Hookean or neo-Hookean solid models, the stress is given explicitly in terms of kinematical quantities. Models for viscoelastic and inelastic responses on the other hand are usually implicit relationships between the stress and the kinematical quantities. Another class of problems wherein it would be natural to develop implicit constitutive theories, though seldom resorted to, are models for bodies that are constrained. In general, for such materials the material moduli that characterize the extra stress could depend on the constraint reaction. (E.g., in an incompressible fluid, the viscosity could depend on the constraint reaction associated with the constraint of incompressibility. In the linear case, this would be the pressure.) Here we discuss such implicit constitutive theories. We also discuss a class of bodies described by an implicit constitutive relation for the specific Helmholtz potential that depends on both the stress and strain, and which does not dissipate in any admissible process. The stress in such a material is not derivable from a potential, i.e., the body is not hyperelastic (Green elastic).},

	abstract = {Technologies for soft tissue analysis are advancing at a rapid place. For instance, elastography, which provides soft tissue strain images, is starting to be tried in clinical practice as a tool for diagnosing cancer. Soft tissue deformation modeling and analysis is also an active area of research that has application in surgery planning and treatment. Typically, quantitative soft tissue analysis uses nominal values of soft tissue biomechanical properties. However, in practice, soft tissue properties can vary significantly between individuals. Hence, for soft tissue methodologies to reach their full potential as patient-specific techniques, there is a need to develop ways to efficiently measure soft tissue mechanical properties in vivo. This paper describes a prototype real-time ultrasound ({US}) indentation test system developed to meet this need. The system is based on the integration of a force sensor and an optical tracking system with a commercial {US} machine integrated with a suite of analysis methodologies. In a study on a single-layer phantom, we used the system to compare various methods of estimating linear elastic properties (via a theoretical approximation, 2-D finite element analysis, 3-D finite element analysis and a standard material-testing method). In a second study on a three-layer gelatin phantom, we describe a new finite-element-based inverse solution for recovering the Young’s moduli of each layer to show how the system can estimate properties of internal components of soft tissue. Finally, we show how the system can be used to derive a modified quasilinear viscoelastic ({QVL}) model on real breast tissue. (e-mail: noble@robots.ox.ac.uk)},

	abstract = {Growth and remodeling in tissues may be modulated by mechanical factors such as stress. For example, in cardiac hypertrophy, alterations in wall stress arising from changes in mechanical loading lead to cardiac growth and remodeling. A general continuum formulation for finite volumetric growth in soft elastic tissues is therefore proposed. The shape change of an unloaded tissue during growth is described by a mapping analogous to the deformation gradient tensor. This mapping is decomposed into a transformation of the local zero-stress reference state and an accompanying elastic deformation that ensures the compatibility of the total growth deformation. Residual stress arises from this elastic deformation. Hence, a complete kinematic formulation for growth in general requires a knowledge of the constitutive law for stress in the tissue. Since growth may in turn be affected by stress in the tissue, a general form for the stress-dependent growth law is proposed as a relation between the symmetric growth-rate tensor and the stress tensor. With a thick-walled hollow cylinder of incompressible, isotropic hyperelastic material as an example, the mechanics of left ventricular hypertrophy are investigated. The results show that transmurally uniform pure circumferential growth, which may be similar to eccentric ventricular hypertrophy, changes the state of residual stress in the heart wall. A model of axially loaded bone is used to test a simple stress-dependent growth law in which growth rate depends on the difference between the stress due to loading and a predetermined growth equilibrium stress.},

We use this model to derive, for a prestressed orthotropic aggregate of cubic crystallites, a birefringence formula which shows explicitly the effects of the orthotropic texture on the acoustoelastic coefficients. From this formula we observe that, generally speaking, we cannot separate the total birefringence into two distinct parts, one reflecting purely the influence of stress on the birefringence, and the other encompassing all the effects of texture. The same formula, on the other hand, provides for each material specific quantitative criteria under which the ‘separation of stress-induced and texture-induced birefringence’ would become meaningful in an approximate sense.},

	abstract = {We introduce a fundamental restriction on the strain energy function and stress tensor for initially stressed elastic solids. The restriction is a consequence of energy conservation and we call it Initial Stress Reference Independence ({ISRI}). It transpires that almost all strain energy functions found in the literature do not satisfy {ISRI}, and therefore may lead to unphysical behaviour. To remedy this shortcoming we derive three strain energy functions that do satisfy the restriction. We also show that using initial strain (often from a virtual configuration) to model initial stress leads to strain energy functions that automatically satisfy {ISRI}. Finally, we reach the following important result: {ISRI} restricts the closed-form expression of the linear stress tensor of initially stressed solids. As this restriction has gone unnoticed, it will open new pathways for the non-destructive determination of initial stresses via ultrasonic experiments, among others.},

For this study, three common engineering materials; alloy 6061-T651 aluminum, 304 stainless steel, and A36 carbon steel were used. This was achieved by performing {ESPI}/hole-drilling stress measurement of a known applied stress in discrete rpm intervals ranging from 2-40K rpm for each material. To produce a known state of stress specimens were bent elastically in a four-point bend fixture. Stress measurements were taken using single-axis electronic speckle-pattern interferometry ({ESPI}). It was found that for 6061-T6 aluminum, accurate and repeatable results can be achieved between speeds of 2-40K rpm. For 304 stainless steel, result accuracy diminishes when drill speeds go below 6K rpm. The A36 steel had a large as-received stress gradient across the longitudinal dimension and was therefore removed from this study.},

A key ingredient in many of these extensions is an appropriate addition theorem: a coherent, thorough exposition of these theorems is given, and computational and numerical issues around them are explored. The application of these methods to different types of problems is also explained; in particular, sound waves, electromagnetic radiation, waves in solids and water waves.

	abstract = {The airways and parenchyma of lung experience large deformations during normal respiration. Spatially accurate predictions of airflow patterns and aerosol transport therefore require respiration to be modeled as a fluid-structure interaction problem. Such computational models in turn require constitutive models for the parencyhma that are both accurate and efficient. Herein, an implicit theory of elasticity is derived from thermodynamics to meet this need, leading to a generic template for strain-energy that is shown to be an exact analogue for the well-known Fung model that is the root of modern constitutive theory of tissues. To support this theory, we also propose a novel definition of Lagrangian strain rate. Unlike the classic definition of Lagrangian strain rate, this new definition is separable into volumetric and deviatoric terms, a separation that is both mathematically and physically justified. Within this framework, a novel material model capable of describing the elastic contribution of the nonlinear response of parenchyma is constructed and characterized against published data.},

	abstract = {Acoustoelasticity, or the change in elastic wave speeds with stress, is a well-studied phenomenon for bulk waves. The effect of stress on Lamb waves is not as well understood, although it is clear that anisotropic stresses will produce anisotropy in the Lamb wave dispersion curves. Here the theory of acoustoelastic Lamb wave propagation is developed for isotropic media subjected to a biaxial, homogeneous stress field. It is shown that, as expected, dispersion curves change anisotropically for most stresses, modes, and frequencies. Interestingly, for some mode-frequency combinations, changes in phase velocity are isotropic even for a biaxial stress field. Theoretical predictions are compared to experimental results for several Lamb wave modes and frequencies for uniaxial loads applied to an aluminum plate, and the agreement is reasonably good.},

In this paper general equations that can be applied to the partial wave technique are presented in order to obtain the dispersion spectra of acoustoelastic Lamb waves in anisotropic plates in either frame of reference. Employing these equations, dispersion curves for the fundamental modes in a pre-stressed transversely isotropic aluminum plate were numerically obtained in both reference frames under longitudinal and transverse loading with the material transverse axis along each of the Cartesian directions, as well as the propagation along a non-principal direction. Results confirm that due to the material natural anisotropy, the speed variation depends not only on the pre-stress direction but also on the material orientation as well as on the polarization of the propagating mode. Similar to bulk waves, the relationship between the speed at the natural and initial frames is a function of the load direction.},

For this purpose exact expressions are derived for the sound velocity and for a natural velocity and their stress derivatives, evaluated at zero stress, in terms of second- and third-order elastic constants. The formulas apply to arbitrary crystal symmetry and to arbitrary stress systems depending on a single scalar variable. Special formulas for hydrostatic pressure and uniaxial stress are listed for the cubic point groups O, Oh, Td, and for isotropic materials. Attention is given to the proper variation of propagation direction with static stress in order to maintain propagation normal to a given crystal face as in ultrasonic experiments, and to the proper separation of isothermal and isentropic coefficients in the results. The simplest and most convenient from of the results employs the natural velocity (natural unstressed length at the same temperature divided by the transit time), which is computed directly from experimental data without correcting the path length for the effect of stress.},

We adopt the formulation of linear elasticity with initial stress and assume that the deviation of the prestressed anisotropic medium from a suitably-chosen, comparative, unstressed and isotropic state be small. No assumption, however, is made on the material anisotropy of the incremental elasticity tensor. With the help of the Stroh formalism, here we derive first-order perturbation formulas for the changes in polarization ratio and phase shift of Rayleigh waves from their respective comparative isotropic value. Examples are given, which show that the perturbation formulas for phase velocity and polarization ratio can serve as a starting point for investigations on the possible advantages of using Rayleigh-wave polarization, as compared with using wave speed, for acoustoelastic measurement of stress.},

Each cylinder is penetrable, with a sound-speed that is close to that in the exterior: the scattering is said to be “weak”. Two classes of methods are used. The first is usually associated with the names of Foldy and Lax. Such methods require a “closure assumption”, in addition to the governing equations. The second class is based on iterative approximations to integral equations of Lippmann–Schwinger type. Such methods do not use a closure approximation. Our main result is that both approaches lead to exactly the same formulas for the effective wavenumber, correct to second-order in scattering strength and second-order in filling fraction. Approximations for the average wavefield are also derived and compared.},

The review is divided into five main parts. In the first part, the effects of multiple scattering on ultrasonic propagation are illustrated on the basis of three experimental examples. In the second and third parts, we present the two possible descriptions for the propagation of an acoustic wave in a random medium. The first one is based on the study of the coherent wave, i.e. the wave amplitude averaged over disorder, whereas the second one deals with the propagation of the incoherent intensity, i.e. the intensity averaged over disorder. We especially insist on the microscopic basis for the phenomenological radiative transfer equation and show how it can be solved in the diffusion approximation. The theory is illustrated with experimental results obtained on a two-dimensional multiple-scattering prototype made of thousands of steel rods randomly distributed and immersed in water. In the fourth part, we present experimental evidence that the diffusion equation fails in describing all the aspects of the propagation of an acoustic wave in a random medium: e.g. the coherent backscattering effect recently observed for ultrasonic waves. We show that this effect arises as a consequence of reciprocity. Finally, in the fifth part, we discuss another property which is not taken into account in the radiative transfer theory: the reversibility of an acoustic wave propagating in a disordered medium.},

Unlike a previous development based upon energy conservation considerations [J. A. Turner and R. L. Weaver, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 93, 2312 (A) (1993)] for a medium containing discrete random scatterers, the present model has been developed from the wave equation and first principles. Appropriate ensemble averaging of the wave equation leads to Dyson and Bethe–Salpeter equations which govern the mean Green’s function and the covariance of the Green’s function, respectively. These equations are expanded for weak heterogeneity and equations of radiative transfer are obtained. The result is valid for attenuations that are small compared with a wave number: α/k≪1. Polarization effects are included, as before, through five elastodynamic Stokes parameters, one longitudinal and four shear. The theory is applied to a statistically homogeneous and statistically isotropic half‐space composed of cubic crystallites illuminated by a plane wave. Results for the angular dependence of backscattered intensity are presented. It is anticipated that this approach may be applicable to microstructural characterization through the study of the time, space, ultrasonic frequency, and angular dependence of multiply scattered ultrasound in elastic media.},

	abstract = {A numerical modeling approach was developed to simulate the propagation of shear and longitudinal waves in arbitrary, dense dispersions of spherical particles. The scattering interactions were modeled with vector multipole functions and boundary condition solutions for each particle. Multiple scattering was simulated by translating the scattered wave fields from one particle to another with the use of translational addition theorems, summing the multiple-scattering contributions, and recalculating the scattering using an iterative method. The approach can simulate 3D dispersions with a variety of particle sizes, compositions, and volume fractions. To test the model, spectra and wave field images were generated from ordered and disordered microstructures containing up to several thousand particles. The model predicted wave propagation phenomena such as refractive focusing and mode conversion. The iterations converged for many particle configurations, but did not converge or only partially converged for certain conditions, specifically large particle dispersions ({\textgreater}100{\textgreater}100{\textless}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}\&gt;{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mn{\textgreater}100{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} particles) at short wavelengths (λ∼particleλ∼particle{\textless}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00002.gif"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}λ{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}∼{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mtext{\textgreater}particle{\textless}/mtext{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} diameter). Incorporating viscoelastic damping into the matrix properties reduced these numerical instabilities. The model is currently constrained by these convergence limitations and by the computation of sufficiently high multipole order for large numbers of particles. The theory and initial results for the model are presented.},

	abstract = {In this article, a backscatter theory for an electrically dense medium is presented. The random medium is modeled by a layer of randomly distributed dielectric spherical scatterers, bounded on top and bottom by a rough surface. The phase matrix for the discrete spherical scatterers is evaluated using the dense medium phase and amplitude correction ({DM}-{PACT}) method (Chuah et al., 1996) so that it can be used for a dense medium (such as snow and sea-ice). This phase matrix differs from the conventional one in that both amplitude and phase corrections for the close-spacing effect are considered. The rough surface is modeled using the integral equation method ({IEM}) (Fung, 1994). The problem is formulated by using radiative transfer theory. The integrodifferential equations are solved using an iterative method. Explicit expressions up to second-order solutions are given. Based on these solutions, terms resulting from three major scattering mechanisms, namely, direct surface, surface–volume, and volume scattering terms, can be identified. The volume interactions include both direct volume and volume–volume interactions. Using this model, dense medium effect and relative contributions of the three major scattering mechanisms are investigated. The study of relative contributions of the various scattering mechanisms is important to indicate the conditions under which a simple incoherent theory, where backscatter returns are obtained by direct addition of volume and direct surface terms, is acceptable. Comparisons are also made with measurements in the laboratory and in the field.},

In this paper, the phase matrix of a dense discrete random medium is developed by relaxing the far-field approximation and accounting for the effect of volume fraction and randomness properties characterized by the variance and correlation function of scatterer positions within the medium. The final expression for the phase matrix differs from the conventional one in two major aspects: there is an amplitude and a phase correction. The concept used in the derivation is analogous to the antenna array theory. The phase matrix for a collection of scatterers is found to be the Stokes matrix of the single scatterer multiplied by a dense medium phase correction factor. The close spacing amplitude correction appears inside the Stokes matrix. When the scatterers are uncorrelated, the phase correction factor approaches unity. The phase matrix is used to calculate the volume scattering coefficients for a unit volume of spherical scatterers, and the results are compared with calculations from other theories, numerical simulations, and laboratory measurements. Results indicate that there should be a distinction between physically dense medium and electrically dense medium},

Comparisons are made with results obtained by using the effective field approximation and the quasicrystalline approximation. Numerical results of the effective dielectric constant and the scattering attenuation rates, as a function of the fractional volume occupied by the scatterers, are illustrated using parameters frequently encountered in the microwave remote sensing of snow and soil moisture. It is shown that the coherent potential method as applied to quasicrystalline approximation is superior to the other approximations in accounting for the overestimation factor.},

We set forth the conditions for the effect of coherent-transmittance quenching, which takes place as a result of the interference between incident and forward-scattered waves. Using the single-scattering approximation we determined size parameters and particle refractive indexes for this interference effect in the case of identical isotropic spherical particles. The influence of polydispersity and the fine structure of light-scattering characteristics on the quenching effect has been estimated. It is shown that the polydispersity destroys this interference effect only at large widths of particle-size distribution functions. The influence of multiple scattering on this effect is considered in the quasi-crystalline approximation. Multiple scattering results in increasing size parameters and decreasing particle concentration at which coherent transmittance quenching takes place in comparison with the case of single scattering. Our theoretical results for suspensions of latex particles in water are in fairly good agreement with the experimental results.},

This has been demonstrated in the past from extensive theoretical, numerical, and experimental studies of electromagnetic wave scattering by densely packed dielectric spheres. Here, electromagnetic wave scattering by densely packed dielectric spheroids with aligned orientation is studied analytically through quasi-crystalline approximation ({QCA}) and {QCA} with coherent potential ({QCA}-{CP}). We assume that the spheroids are electrically small so that single-particle scattering is simple. Low-frequency {QCA} and {QCA}-{CP} solutions are obtained for the average Green’s function and the effective permittivity tensor. For {QCA}-{CP}, the low-frequency expansion of the uniaxial dyadic Green’s function is required. The real parts of the effective permittivities from {QCA} and {QCA}-{CP} are compared with the Maxwell–Garnett mixing formula. {QCA} gives results identical to those with the mixing formula, while {QCA}-{CP} gives slightly higher values. The extinction coefficients from {QCA} and {QCA}-{CP} are compared with results from Monte Carlo simulations. Both {QCA} and {QCA}-{CP} agree well with simulations, although qualitative disagreement is evident at higher fractional volumes.},

	abstract = {The scattering of a plane electromagnetic wave obliquely incident on a layer of dense medium consisting of dielectric spherical particles of finite sizes and with size distributions is studied. The spherical particles are of sizes comparable to wavelength so that Mie scattering is used to describe the single particle scattering characteristics. The coherent wave is studied with quasicrystalline approximation using the cross pair distribution functions of multiple sizes governed by Percus-Yevick approximation. The incoherent scattered wave is calculated with the distorted Born approximation with the result expressed in terms of a product of the T-matrices of particles of different sizes and permittivities and the Fourier transform of the cross pair distribution functions. The coherent wave effective propagation constants, the attenuation rates and the backscattering coefficients are illustrated numerically, with examples chosen to illustrate microwave and millimeter wave scattering from snow cover in the frequency range of 5 {GHz} to 95 {GHz}, and mean grain radius between 0.03 cm to 0.09 cm. Salient features of the numerical results for scattering from snow with size distribution are: 1. Correlated dense medium scattering is less than independent scattering at low frequency, a fact that is consistent with controlled laboratory experiment. 2. Scattering from dense medium of a Rayleigh size distribution with an average radius can be much larger than the case of monodisperse particles of the sizes identical to that average radius. 3. The scattering attenuation rate increases rapidly with frequency at low frequency regime and begins to level off at high frequency regime. 4. The coherent wave scattering attenuation rate is large in snow at frequencies above 15 {GHz} indicating large optical thickness and the importance of multiple scattering. Comparisons with extinction measurements of dry snow at 18 {GHz}, 35 {GHz}, 60 {GHz}, and 90 {GHz} are made.},

	abstract = {In an isotropic, thermoelastic solid shear waves are unaltered by thermal effects. However, two distinct dilatational waves exist, both of which are dispersed and attenuated by the medium. One of the waves (denoted the E wave) is close in character to the pure elastic wave, the other wave (denoted the T wave) is similar in nature to the pure thermal wave.The properties of the two dilatational motions are studied and relations are given expressing the variation, in each, of phase velocity, amplitude attenuation, and specific loss with impressed frequency. For the E wave the result is verified that this disturbance propagates at the adiabatic velocity at low frequencies and at the isothermal velocity at very high frequencies. An explanation based on physical considerations is offered to account for this generally overlooked phenomenon. It is further found that the amplitude is attenuated exponentially as the square of the frequency at relatively low frequencies, but approaches finite value as the frequency increases without limit. The specific loss reaches maximum for the E wave, a minimum for the T wave, near the frequency whose period is equal to the relaxation time due to thermal currents.Finally, the ratios are computed of the amplitude of the temperature to the amplitude of the displacement in each of the two modes of motion. Numerical work indicates that, for metals at room temperature, the effect of coupling between elastic and thermal motions is very small.},

In this paper, two strategies are tested that allow for the elicitation of size information from attenuation spectra when the relevant model parameters are only partially known. The first strategy uses the data on measured sound speed as additional information, which facilitates the fitting of the unknown model parameters parallel to the calculation of the particle size distribution. The second strategy comprises the formation of an empirical model that is based on the principal components, which are obtained by decomposing a measured attenuation spectrum into a set of orthogonal basic spectra. Both strategies are tested with colloidal emulsions: the first one for the cases of unknown particle concentration and unknown specific heat of the droplets, the second one for monitoring changes in the state of dispersion and in the temperature.},

After discussion of three modeling approaches and their implementation into the general {ECAH} framework, and demonstration of their effect on the acoustic field, the behavior of each thus defined model is analyzed as a function of particle concentration. In all cases, convergence to the well-established {ECAH} result is observed in the dilute limit. At high concentrations, particularly good behavior is found for a core−shell (pseudofluid) model, both for suspensions and emulsions. This model correctly predicts an increase of attenuation with particle concentration which is less than linear, in agreement with experimental observations.},

The dispersion equation of the coherent wave inside the slab must be solved numerically. For solid cylinders, there is only one solution corresponding to a mean free path of the coherent wave larger than one wavelength. In that case, the slab region may be described as an effective dissipative fluid medium, and its reflection and transmission coefficients may be formally written as those of a fluid plate. For thin hollow shells, a second solution of the dispersion equation is found, at concentrations large enough for the shells to be coupled via the radiation of a circumferential Scholte–Stoneley A wave on each shell. This occurs at a few resonance frequencies of the shells. At those frequencies, then, two different coherent waves propagate in the slab, and it can no longer be considered a dissipating fluid slab.},

Although novel optical microscopy methods have been developed to probe cellular features beyond the diffraction limit, nanometer-scale quantification remains still inaccessible for in situ tissue. Here we demonstrate that, without actually resolving specific geometrical feature, {OCT} can be sensitive to tissue structural properties at the nanometer length scale. The statistical mass-density distribution in tissue is quantified by its autocorrelation function modeled by the Whittle-Mateŕn functional family. By measuring the wavelength-dependent backscattering coefficient μb(λ) and the scattering coefficient μs, we introduce a technique called inverse spectroscopic {OCT} ({ISOCT}) to quantify the mass-density correlation function. We find that the length scale of sensitivity of {ISOCT} ranges from {\textasciitilde}30 to {\textasciitilde}450 nm. Although these sub-diffractional length scales are below the spatial resolution of {OCT} and therefore not resolvable, they are nonetheless detectable. The sub-diffractional sensitivity is validated by 1) numerical simulations; 2) tissue phantom studies; and 3) ex vivo colon tissue measurements cross-validated by scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}). Finally, the 3D imaging capability of {ISOCT} is demonstrated with ex vivo rat buccal and human colon samples.},

Recently, the synthesis of larger-than-usual {GNRs} ({LGNRs}, ∼ 100 × 30 nm) has been demonstrated. However, {LGNRs} have not been biofunctionalized and therefore remain absent from biomedical literature to date. Here we report the successful biofunctionalization of {LGNRs}, which produces highly stable particles that exhibit a narrow spectral peak ({FWHM} ∼100 nm). We further demonstrated that functionalized {LGNRs} can be used as highly sensitive scattering contrast agents by detecting individual {LGNRs} in clear liquids. Owing to their increased optical cross sections, we found that {LGNRs} exhibited up to 32-fold greater backscattering than conventional {GNRs}. We leveraged these enhanced optical properties to detect {LGNRs} in the vasculature of live tumor-bearing mice. With {LGNR} contrast enhancement, we were able to visualize tumor blood vessels at depths that were otherwise undetectable. We expect that the particles reported herein will enable immediate sensitivity improvements in a wide array of biomedical imaging and sensing techniques that rely on conventional {GNRs}.},

	abstract = {Multiple scattering is a major source that limits light penetration into biotissues, thereby preventing visualization of the deep microstructures for high-resolution optical imaging techniques. The optical clearing approach is a new adventure in biomedical optics for manipulating the optical properties of tissue; for example, the scattering coefficient and the degree of forward scattering of photons, by the use of the chemical administration method in order to improve the optical imaging depth, particularly for the recently developed optical coherence tomography ({OCT}). This paper investigates systematically how the multiple scattering affects signal attenuation and localization in general, and how the alterations of optical properties of tissue enhance the optical imaging depth and signal localization in particular, by the use of Monte Carlo simulations through the separate considerations of the least scattered photons ({LSP}) and multiple scattered photons ({MSP}). The {LSP} are those photons that contribute to the precise {OCT} signal, i.e. localization, and the {MSP} are those that degrade the {OCT} signal. It is shown that with either the reduction of the scattering coefficient or the increase of the degree of forward scattering, signal localization and imaging depth for {OCT} is enhanced. Whilst the increase of the anisotropic factor of the medium is more efficient in improving signal localization, it introduces more scattering events for the photons travelling within the tissue for both the {LSP} and {MSP}. It is also found that the {OCT} imaging resolution is almost reduced exponentially with the increase of the probing depth as opposed to the claimed system resolution. We demonstrate that optical clearing could be a useful tool to improve the imaging resolution when the light progressively penetrates the high scattering medium. Experimental results are also presented to show intuitively how multiple scattering affects {OCT} signal profiles by the use of intralipid solution and healthy human whole blood, representing moderately and highly scattering media respectively.},

When a Newton-type inverse algorithm is used, the successful recovery of the particle size distribution, in the form of a Weibull function, and the volume fraction of polystyrene suspensions is achieved. Our results are in excellent agreement with dynamic light-scattering size distribution measurements. On consideration of the particle mass conservation as an additional constraint penalty term in the inverse algorithm, it is shown that the quality of the particle size distribution reconstruction can be improved. Because no calibration is needed, photon migration techniques are especially suited for on-line measurement of the particle size distribution and the volume fraction in the chemical- and the pharmaceutical-based industries.},

Various spatial geometries are considered, with emphasis on low-dimensional (quasi-1D and 2D) systems. Calculations are based on the supermatrix σ-model approach. The method reproduces, in so-called zero-mode approximation, the universal random matrix theory ({RMT}) results for the energy-level and eigenfunction fluctuations. Going beyond this approximation allows us to study system-specific deviations from universality, which are determined by the diffusive classical dynamics in the system. These deviations are especially strong in the far “tails” of the distribution function of the eigenfunction amplitudes (as well as of some related quantities, such as local density of states, relaxation time, etc.). These asymptotic “tails” are governed by anomalously localized states which are formed in rare realizations of the random potential. The deviations of the level and eigenfunction statistics from their {RMT} form strengthen with increasing disorder and become especially pronounced at the Anderson metal–insulator transition. In this regime, the wave functions are multifractal, while the level statistics acquires a scale-independent form with distinct critical features. Fluctuations of the conductance and of the local intensity of a classical wave radiated by a point-like source in the quasi-1D geometry are also studied within the σ-model approach. For a ballistic system with rough surface an appropriately modified (“ballistic”) σ-model is used. Finally, the interplay of the fluctuations and the electron–electron interaction in small samples is discussed, with application to the Coulomb blockade spectra.},

These phenomena are encoded in effective material parameters that can be electronic, magnetic, acoustic, or elastic, and must adequately represent the wave interaction behavior in the composite within desired frequency ranges. In some cases—for example, the low frequency regime—there exist various efficient ways by which effective material parameters for wave propagation in metamaterials may be found. However, the general problem of predicting frequency-dependent dynamic effective constants has remained unsolved. Here, we obtain novel mathematical expressions for the effective parameters of two-dimensional metamaterial systems valid at higher frequencies and wavelengths than previously possible. By way of an example, random configurations of cylindrical scatterers are considered, in various physical contexts: sound waves in a compressible fluid, anti-plane elastic waves, and electromagnetic waves. Our results point towards a paradigm shift in our understanding of these effective properties, and metamaterial designs with functionalities beyond the low-frequency regime are now open for innovation.},

This theory is used to explain phenomena observed in a controlled laboratory experiment. The experimental data indicate that, in a dense medium with small particles, both the coherent attenuation rate and bistatic intensities first increase with the volume fraction of the particles until a maximum is reached, and then decrease when the volume fraction further increases. Thus, attenuation rates and bistatic scattering exhibit a peak as a function of the concentration of particles. The magnitudes of both are also less than those predicted by the independent scattering assumption and the conventional radiative transfer theory. These phenomena cannot be explained by the conventional radiative transfer theory. It is shown that the dense medium radiative transfer theory is in agreement with these experimental features},

The relationship between snow water equivalence ({SWE}) and {SAR} backscattering coefficients at C- and X-band (5.5 and 9.6 {GHz}) can be either positive or negative. Therefore, discovery of the relationship with an empirical approach is unrealistic. Instead, the authors estimate snow depth and particle size using {SIR}-C/X-{SAR} imagery from a physically-based first order backscattering model through analyses of the importance of each scattering term and its sensitivity to snow properties. Using numerically simulated backscattering values, the authors develop semi-empirical models for characterizing the snow-ground interaction terms, the relationships between the ground surface backscattering components, and the snowpack extinction properties at C-band and X-band. With these relationships, snow depth and optical equivalent grain size can be estimated from {SIR}-C/X-{SAR} measurements. Validation using three {SIR}-C/X-{SAR} images shows that the algorithm performs usefully for incidence angles greater than 300, with root mean square errors ({RMSEs}) of 34 cm and 0.27 mm for estimating snow depth and ice optical equivalent particle radius, respectively.},

The effects of a size distribution are included. Experimental results indicate that at low densities, the measured extinction rate increases linearly with concentration in agreement with independent scattering. As concentration further increases, the extinction curve turns convex and is lower than independent scattering. However, it is higher than that predicted by {QCA}-{PY}.

	abstract = {Tree inventories, inter alia, need information on the tree species. Previous studies aimed at distinguishing tree species based on three dimensional tree structure metrics derived from airborne laser scanning ({ALS}) point clouds or based on features from full-waveform ({FW}) laser scanning data provided by today's sensors. Classifications based on {FW} features mainly use echo amplitude, pulse energy (hereafter referred to as energy) and width, which are typically retrieved by waveform decomposition, often performed using the symmetric Gaussian distribution function.
However, for forested areas, the symmetry of the echo shape is potentially modified by multiple scattering and the distribution of scattering elements (e.g. leaves). We assess the potential of processing full-waveform {ALS} data such that the third and fourth statistical moments, i.e. the echo skewness and the echo kurtosis, can be retrieved in addition to the amplitude, energy and {FWHM}. We propose a waveform decomposition approach using the skew normal distribution ({SND}) function, which enables the modelling of skewed echoes. We investigate the difference of tree-crown aggregated {SND} derived {FW} features between seven tree species (969 individual trees) in a temperate mixed forest with the aim of detecting the most descriptive echo features. The such derived {FW} features are tested for species classification.
The results reveal that the largest differences across the tree species are in the mean energy of the first echoes (15 out of 21 species pairs show differences), followed by the mean amplitude of the first echoes and the mean skewness of all echoes originating from a single crown (14 out of 21 species pairs show differences against each other for both features).
The differentiation of coniferous and deciduous trees benefits from the features derived from the {SND} decomposition compared to the use of echo amplitude only (0.39 vs. 0.61 in Cohen's κ). As the classification accuracy of the three dominant tree species within the test site only shows a small increase (0.20 vs. 0.26 in Cohen's κ) by adding {FW} features, we propose the use of such features in combination with features from multispectral data for this purpose.
The {SND} decomposition is comparable to the Gaussian decomposition regarding the decomposition accuracy ({RMSE} = 4.45 vs. {RMSE} = 3.50) and computational cost. Hence, we propose the default use of the {SND} decomposition, as the {SND} is a more flexible function, allowing for the modelling of normally distributed echoes, as well as the fitting of skewed echoes, while no limitations regarding the direction of the skewness are introduced. We attribute the difficulties in the tree species classification to the relatively wide ranges of the crown aggregated features within one species, which for some features results in a considerable overlap of the feature ranges across the species.},

Relying on fundamental scattering principles governing the interaction of polarized laser light with distinctly shaped hydrometers, this remote-sensing technique has contributed to our knowledge of the composition and structure of a variety of cloud types. For example, polarization lidar is a key component of current climate-research programs to characterize the properties of cirrus clouds, and is an integral part of multiple remote-sensor studies of mixed-phase cloud systems, such as winter mountain storms. Although unambiguous cloud-phase discrimination and the identification of some ice particle types and orientations are demonstrated capabilities, recent theoretical approaches involving ice crystal ray-tracing and cloud microphysical model simulations are, promising to increase the utility of the technique. New results simulating the single and multiple scattering properties of precipitating mixed-phase clouds are given for illustration of such methods.},

	abstract = {We report the results of an extensive study of the scattering of light by size and size–shape distributions of randomly oriented prolate and oblate spheroids with the index of refraction 1.5 + 0.02i typical of some mineral terrestrial aerosols. The scattering calculations have been carried out with Waterman’s T-matrix approach, as developed recently by Mishchenko [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 8, 871 (1991); Appl. Opt. 32, 4562 (1993)]. Our main interest is in light scattering by polydisperse models of nonspherical particles because averaging over sizes provides more realistic modeling of natural ensembles of scattering particles and washes out the interference structure and ripple typical of monodisperse scattering patterns, thus enabling us to derive meaningful conclusions about the effects of particle nonsphericity on light scattering. Following Hansen and Travis [Space Sci. Rev. 16, 527 (1974)], we show that scattering properties of most physically plausible size distributions of randomly oriented nonspherical particles depend primarily on the effective equivalent-sphere radius and effective variance of the distribution, the actual shape of the distribution having a minor influence. To minimize the computational burden, we have adopted a computationally convenient power law distribution of particle equivalent-sphere radii n(r) ∝ r−3, r1 ≤ r ≤ r2. The effective variance of the size distribution is fixed at 0.1, and the effective size parameter continuously varies from 0 to 15. We present results of computer calculations for 24 prolate and oblate spheroidal shapes with aspect ratios from 1.1 to 2.2. The elements of the scattering matrix for the whole range of size parameters and scattering angles are displayed in the form of contour plots. Computational results are compared with analogous calculations for surface-equivalent spheres, and the effects of particle shape on light scattering are discussed in detail.},

Within the appropriate limits, it exhibits dilute-alloy, virtual-crystal, and well separated impurity-band behavior.

Explicit results are exhibited for the total density of states, the partial density contributed by each component, and such k-dependent properties as the Bloch-wave spectral density and the distribution function.

The correlations between the positions of the scatterers are explicitly taken into account. By making use of the quasicrystalline approximation and a generalization of the coherent-potential prescription, a procedure for calculating ⟨G⟩ is proposed. Because of the use of the quasicrystalline approximation, it involves only the radial distribution function of the scatterers in addition to the scatterer-electron interaction potential. It is shown that the procedure reduces to the coherent-potential approximation for randomly distributed scatterers, i.e., no short-range order, and to Korringa's band-structure calculation for an order lattice. It is pointed out that the method is applicable to the problem of electronic states in random alloys and that of vibrational spectra of imperfect crystals.},

The novel feature of the formulation is the introduction of a “momentum polarization” to cope with density variations in a way that exactly parallels the stress polarization's correspondence with variations in moduli. To illustrate the use of the equations, scattering by an ellipsoidal inhomogeneity in a generally anisotropic matrix is studied in the Rayleigh limit and an asymptotic formula for its scattering cross-section is given. Detailed results are presented for a spheroidal inhomogeneity in an isotropic matrix, with explicit limiting forms for the scattering cross-sections of penny-shaped cracks, rigid circular discs and rigid needles.},

In carbon steels, a lower value of ultrasonic velocity was observed for the martensite in relation to the other microstructures, while the opposite was observed in terms of ultrasonic attenuation.

	abstract = {The behaviour of 5 {MHz} ultrasound backscattered at the Rayleigh angle from waterimmersed specimens of En3A, En9 and En25 steel has been related to microstructural features induced by heat treatment. The range of phase structures considered is a substantial extension on what has been described in the previous literature. In the case of the En25 samples, which all had the same mean grain size, the backscattered energy decreased systematically with increasing hardness, within the standard deviation of the energy backscattered from different regions of the same sample. When all samples of the three types of steel were compared at constant grain size in the Rayleigh scattering region, the backscattered energy was found to vary systematically with phase structure in the decreasing sequence: 80\% pearlite-20\% ferrite {\textgreater} bainite {\textgreater} tempered martensite {\textgreater} 80\%ferrite-20\%pearlite {\textgreater} acicular ferrite {\textgreater} martensite. The intensity of backscattering can be changed by up to 20 {dB} by heat treatment, with a standard deviation of ∼ 1.5 {dB} for repeat measurements at the same sample point, while the standard deviation for thesignal intensity arising from different regions of the same specimen surface varied between 2 and 4 {dB}. It appears that the backscatter technique can readily distinguish between different phase structures as produced, for example, by oven cooling and air cooling, and it is worth noting that the data were obtained using a standard, relatively inexpensive, ultrasonic flaw detector.},

By taking into proper account the singularity of the dyadic Green's function in the renormalization method, the low-frequency limit of vector electromagnetic wave scattering from a random medium with large variance of permittivity function is studied. The strong fluctuation random theory is then applied to a ‘discrete scatterer’ problem in which the permittivity can assume only two values. It is then shown that the results of the strong fluctuation theory are consistent with those derived from discrete scatterer theory for all values of dielectric constants of the scatterers. Numerical results of the effective permittivity are illustrated for random media with isotropic and anisotropic correlation functions. It is shown that the results of the weak fluctuations theory differ significantly from those of the strong fluctuation theory. The second moment of the field in the backscattering direction is calculated using the distorted Born approximation and illustrated using parameters typically encountered in microwave remote sensing of vegetation.},

A precise treatment of the diffuse intensity is derived which automatically includes the effects of boundary layers. Effects such as the enhanced backscatter cone and imaging of objects in opaque media are also discussed within this framework. This approach is extended to mesoscopic correlations between multiple scattered intensities that arise when scattering is strong. These correlations arise from the underlying wave character. The derivation of correlation functions and intensity distribution functions is given and experimental data are discussed. Although the focus is on light scattering, the theory is also applicable to microwaves, sound waves, and noninteracting electrons.},

The model is here applied to the case of oil in water emulsions in which thermal effects are dominant. The additional contributions are expressed in terms of the scattering coefficients for conversion between compressional and thermal modes and vice versa. These terms are due to the effect of thermal waves produced at one particle being reconverted into the compressional mode at neighboring particles. The effects are demonstrated by numerical simulations for a sunflower oil in water emulsion which show that the additional terms are significant at low frequency and high concentrations. Comparison is also made with experimental data for a hexadecane in water emulsion. Although qualitative agreement is demonstrated, there are some quantitative differences, which are attributed to uncertainties in the physical properties, in the experimental data, or in the assumptions made in the model.},

Our observations of polar regions have evolved from happenstance ship sightings and isolated harbor icing records to routine global records obtained by those satellites. Thanks to such abundant data, we now know a great deal about the ice-covered seas, which constitute about 10\% of the Earth's surface. This explosion of information about sea ice has fascinated scientists for some 20 years.

	abstract = {In this paper, we use a 2-D elastodynamic boundary integral equation or boundary element method ({BEM}) to solve multiple scattering problems due to existence of cracks or inclusions. The method is based on the integral representation of a scattered wavefield by assuming a fictitious source distribution on the scattering objects or inclusions (i.e. mathematical description of Huygens' principle), and the fictitious source distribution can be found by matching appropriate boundary conditions at the boundary of the inclusions. The method is called indirect boundary element method. Three numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the versatility of the {BEM} method. The first example shows that different spatial arrangements of the same scatters lead to profound differences in scattering characteristics, in particular the frequency contents of the transmitted wavefields using the method of time-frequency analysis. The second example shows the effects of power-law or fractal distribution of scalelengths on transmitted wavefields, and we conclude that frequency characteristics, such as the frequency of the peak attenuation, can be related to spatial size parameters of the model. In the third example, we show that orientated inclusions with aspect ratio less than unity have strong effects on the amplitudes of transmitted waves, and this has an important implication in characterizing inclusions and fractures using azimuthal variation in amplitudes (or attenuation anisotropy).},

	abstract = {Ultrasound contrast agents ({UCA}), such as microbubbles, enhance the scattering properties of blood, which is otherwise hypoechoic. The multiple scattering interactions of the acoustic field with {UCA} are poorly understood due to the complexity of the multiple scattering theories and the nonlinear microbubble response. The majority of bubble models describe the behavior of {UCA} as single, isolated microbubbles suspended in infinite medium. Multiple scattering models such as the independent scattering approximation can approximate phase velocity and attenuation for low scatterer volume fractions. However, all current models and simulation approaches only describe multiple scattering and nonlinear bubble dynamics separately. Here we present an approach that combines two existing models: (1) a full-wave model that describes nonlinear propagation and scattering interactions in a heterogeneous attenuating medium and (2) a Paul–Sarkar model that describes the nonlinear interactions between an acoustic field and microbubbles. These two models were solved numerically and combined with an iterative approach. The convergence of this combined model was explored in silico for 0.5 × 10 6 microbubbles ml −1 , 1\% and 2\% bubble concentration by volume. The backscattering predicted by our modeling approach was verified experimentally with water tank measurements performed with a 128-element linear array transducer. An excellent agreement in terms of the fundamental and harmonic acoustic fields is shown. Additionally, our model correctly predicts the phase velocity and attenuation measured using through transmission and predicted by the independent scattering approximation.},

Light scattering by molecules and by a horizontally homogeneous cloud is taken into account. Lidar parameters, including laser beam divergence, can be freely chosen. Up to 3 orders of scattering are calculated. Furthermore, an inversion technique for the retrieval of cloud extinction profiles from measurements with elastic-backscatter lidars is proposed that explicitly takes multiple scattering into account. It is found that for typical lidar system parameters such as those of the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations ({CALIPSO}) instrument multiple scattering does not significantly affect depolarization-ratio measurements in cirrus clouds with small to moderate optical depths. For all simulated clouds, the absolute value of the difference between measured and single-scattering volume depolarization ratio is {\textless}0.006. The particle depolarization ratio can be calculated from the measured volume depolarization ratio and the retrieved backscatter ratio without degradation of accuracy; thus characterization of the various cirrus categories in terms of the particle depolarization ratio and retrieval of cloud microphysical properties is feasible from space.

For all practical purposes, these are the cloud's space-time Green functions ({GFs}). In a Fourier-Laplace expansion of the space-time {GF}, the leading term is representative of solar remote-sensing (i.e., steady/uniform source) while higher-order terms correspond to active approaches with temporal- and/or spatial- resolution capabilities. Radiative {GF} theory is tractable within the limits of photon-diffusion theory and homogeneous clouds. Monte Carlo simulations with realistically variable cloud models are used to extend the range of validity of analytical {GF} theory with minor modifications. {GF} theory tells us that physical and optical cloud thicknesses can be retrieved from off-beam cloud lidar returns.},

The second application is used to explicitly quantify the scintillation of the transmitted beam and the third application to quantify the statistical stability of the Wigner transform.},

In this paper we consider a distributed field of weak microscatterers, like aerosols in the atmosphere, which coexists with microstructured clutter in the medium, like the fluctuations of the index of refraction of the turbulent  atmosphere. We analyze the Wigner transform or the angularly resolved intensity profile of the backscattered wave when the incident wave is a beam in the paraxial regime and when the Born approximation is valid for the microscatterers. An enhanced backscattering phenomenon is proved, and the properties of the enhanced backscattering cone (relative amplitude and profile) are shown to depend on the statistical parameters of the microstructure but not on the microscatterers. These results are based on a multiscale analysis of the fourth-order moment of the fundamental solution of the white-noise paraxial wave equation. They pave the way for an estimation method of the statistical parameters of the microstructure from the observation of the enhanced backscattering cone. In our scaling argument we differentiate the two important canonical scaling regimes, which are the scintillation regime and the spot dancing regime.},

The medium is terminated by an oblique interface at one end (the bottom) and pressure release type boundary conditions at the other end (the top). The tilt of the bottom interface is relatively small so that the dominant contributions to the wave field are confined to a paraxial tube. This study generalizes the basic formulation in terms of Itô–Schrödinger equations in a one-dimensional deterministic background, describing the macrostructure, to one in which the background is more complicated. It provides the first step toward the analysis of scattered waves in general background media modulated by a random microstructure. We discuss in detail the enhanced backscattering phenomenon or weak localization in this setting, with a tilted interface imbedded in the random medium, and find that the backscattering cone does not depend on the tilt. We also find that the enhanced backscattering phenomenon is not affected by the replacement of a specular interface with a diffusive interface.},

	abstract = {Traditional imaging methods use coherent signals as data. Here, we discuss recent developments in imaging that aim at exploiting as data incoherent noisy signals that are not associated with well-defined arrival times. Indeed, signal constituents that in a classical setting may be regarded as noise may contain important information about the medium to be imaged. We show how it is possible to use the statistics of such noisy signals, specifically, the second-order statistics, for imaging. We consider two particular situations: first, the estimation of an (“empirical”) Green's function from noisy signals which can subsequently be used in imaging; second, the localization of a cluster of random sources from noisy signals (passive imaging). The analysis presented here is based on assuming a remote sensing scaling and the paraxial approximation, and it uses in part the results set forth in Papanicolaou, Ryzhik, and Solna [{SIAM} J. Appl. Math., 64 (2004), pp. 1133–1155] that relate to time-reversal, statistical stability, and superresolution. Robustness with respect to modeling assumptions is illustrated by considering other scaling regimes also. We demonstrate how the estimation problem and its robustness can be considered as a dual to that of time-reversal and stable superresolution. We obtain a novel analysis and foundation for the use of ambient seismic noise in body-wave (tomographic) imaging, motivated by the recent successes of surface-wave tomography using ambient seismic noise.},

In this paper we discuss a rigorous scalar wave theory as a model to represent the enhanced backscattering (weak localization) of light for finite slabs. In addition, we discuss a general theory based on a diffusion approximation, and the resulting angular-dependent enhanced backscattering intensity will be presented in closed form for finite slabs and for general albedo. New transmission and reflection experiments for strongly scattering media are presented. Two types of liquid suspensions have been used as study object: polystyrene spheres in water and suspensions of {TiO}2 particles in 2-methylpentane-2,4-diol. From these experiments scattering mean free paths and transport mean free paths have been obtained. Relative values for the transport mean free paths could also independently be inferred from the observation of the angular dependence of enhanced (interference) backscattering. The observed shapes and widths of the enhanced backscattering cones are in very good agreement with the calculated values. A less satisfying feature is that the theory predicts a backscattering intensity of twice the background intensity, while the experimental value is some 15–20 \% lower.},

Using \$n\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eff\}\}\$ as calculated by the Energy Coherent Potential Approximation we are able to predict the transport mean free path of monodisperse photonic glass. This model without any fit parameter is in qualitative agreement with numerical simulations and in quantitative agreement with spectrally resolved coherent backscattering measurements on new specially synthesized polystyrene photonic glasses. These materials exhibit resonant light scattering perturbed by strong near field coupling, all captured within the model. Our model might be used to maximize the scattering strength of high index photonic glasses, which are a key in the search for Anderson Localization of light in 3D.},

	abstract = {Vertical laser beams are often used at ground-based cosmic ray observatories employing the fluorescence technique for characterizing the height-dependent properties of the atmosphere, as well as for calibration and telescope alignment studies. The light flux received at a detector from a laser is typically assumed to be only singly scattered out of the beam, with no possibility for the multiple scattering of photons initially scattered in other directions back into the detector’s field of view. We present the results of a new simulation for the scattering of light from a vertically-directed laser beam, and derive a parametrization for the multiple scattered signal expected at a detector from such a source as a function of the prevailing atmospheric conditions. The parametrization is then used to estimate the increase in the reconstructed height-dependent aerosol loading when recovered using a laser-based technique.},

	abstract = {A technique is developed for measurement of bubble, droplet and particle-size distributions in multiphase systems, based on the propagation speed and attenuation of ultrasound. The measurement of the size distribution of the dispersed phase in multiphase systems was desired to analyze the mass-transfer mechanism in gas-liquid-liquid and gas-liquid-solid systems. To obtain this information, both the ultrasonic velocity and the attenuation coefficient of tone-burst signals are determined for a large frequency range (typically 100 {kHz} – 100 {MHz}). From these parameters, the size distributions and the volume fraction of the different dispersed phases can be determined using a scattering model. It was shown that the interfacial area can be determined very accurately, however, for the exact size distribution of the gas bubbles in the used size range (1–3 mm) an independent gas holdup determination is required. Experiments were performed in gas-liquid, solid-liquid, and gas-liquid-solid systems. The results showed good agreement of the particle-size distribution compared to a commercial laser-scattering analyzer, both with and without gas bubbles present. Furthermore, a good agreement between the scattering model and the experiments was found in the systems that contained gas bubbles, but these results should be validated using for instance, a digital camera technique. © 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers {AIChE} J, 50: 2750–2762, 2004},

This was achieved by accounting for the effect of detector size and shift in the frequency spectrum under dense conditions in the theoretical model and deconvolution algorithm, respectively.

These conventional methods are useful for the void fraction around 10-6 or lower. However, the change of compressibility in the bubbly water also should be considered in bubble sizing for the void fraction around 10-5 or higher. Recently the sound speed as well as sound attenuation was considered for acoustic bubble size estimation in bubbly water. In this paper, the sound speed estimated from sound attenuation in bubbly water by an iterative method is used for a bubble counting. This new iterative inverse bubble sizing technique is numerically tested for bubble distributions of single-size Gaussian, and power-law functions. The numerical simulation results are in agreement with the given bubble distributions even for the high void fractions of 10-4-10-3. It suggests that the iterative inverse technique can be a very powerful tool for practical use in acoustic bubble counting in the ocean},

	abstract = {The most popular technique for estimating the gas bubble size distribution ({BSD}) in liquids is through the inversion of measured attenuation and/or sound speed of a travelling wave. The model inherent in such inversions never exactly matches the conditions of the measurement, and the size of the resulting error (which could well be small in quasi-free field conditions) cannot be quantified if only a free field code exists. Users may be unaware of errors because, with sufficient regularization, such inversions can always be made to produce an answer, the accuracy of which is unknown unless independent (e.g. optical) measurements are made. This study was commissioned to assess the size of this error for the mercury-filled steel pipelines of the target test facility ({TTF}) of the spallation neutron source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, {TN}, {USA}. Large errors in estimating the {BSD} (greater than 1000\% overcounts/undercounts) are predicted. A new inversion technique appropriate for pipelines such as {TTF} gives good {BSD} estimations if the frequency range is sufficiently broad. However, it also shows that implementation of the planned reduction in frequency bandwidth for the {TTF} bubble sensor would make even this inversion insufficient to obtain an accurate {BSD} in {TTF}.},

We may wish to characterize the effects of clouds or water droplets along the line of sight between an airplane and a radar installation, or we may be interested in using radar to probe the random medium itself, such as in determining snow depth and particle size. In all of these problems it is necessary to predict the propagation constant in the “random” medium. The purpose of this paper is to characterize the accuracy of the quasi-crystalline approximation and other associated methods of determining the effective permittivity for two-dimensional (2-D) random media. A numerical method based on the method of moments is used as a gauge for comparison with the theoretical methods. After deriving the 2-D quasi-crystalline approximation and presenting the numerical method, the behavior of the effective permittivity is analyzed for a range of particle sizes, volume fractions and dielectric losses. From this analysis, regions of validity for the theoretical methods are determined. An investigation is also given which explores the effect of particle arrangement methods on the pair distribution function which, in turn, is shown to have a significant effect on the imaginary component of the effective permittivity},

The electromagnetic fields are calculated by Numerical Solutions of 3D Maxwell Equations ({NMM}3D) using the method of Foldy-Lax multiple scattering equations combined with method of the body of revolution ({BOR}). Using the calculated transmission, we derive, the “tau”, the optical thickness, which describes the magnitude of the transmission. Two cases are considered: the short cylinders case and the extended-cylinders case. The case of short cylinders is that the lengths of cylinders are much smaller than the layer thickness, while the case of extended cylinders is that the lengths of the cylinders are the same as or comparable to the layer thickness. Numerical results are illustrated for plane vertical polarized waves obliquely incident on the layer of cylinders. The {NMM}3D results for the extended-cylinders case show large differences of transmission from the results of approaches such as effective permittivity ({EP}), the distorted Born approximation ({DBA}), and the radiative transfer equation ({RTE}). For the case of short cylinders, the {NMM}3D results are in close agreement with those from {EP}, {DBA} and {RTE}.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we provide a new example of the solution of a finite deformation boundary-value problem for a residually stressed elastic body. Specifically, we analyse the problem of the combined extension, inflation and torsion of a circular cylindrical tube subject to radial and circumferential residual stresses and governed by a residual-stress dependent nonlinear elastic constitutive law. The problem is first of all formulated for a general elastic strain-energy function, and compact expressions in the form of integrals are obtained for the pressure, axial load and torsional moment required to maintain the given deformation. For two specific simple prototype strain-energy functions that include residual stress, the integrals are evaluated to give explicit closed-form expressions for the pressure, axial load and torsional moment. The dependence of these quantities on a measure of the radial strain is illustrated graphically for different values of the parameters (in dimensionless form) involved, in particular the tube thickness, the amount of torsion and the strength of the residual stress. The results for the two strain-energy functions are compared and also compared with results when there is no residual stress.},

In detail we will consider the self-consistent methods applied to linear elastic problems, based on some approximate and closing assumptions for truncating of an infinite system of integral equations involved and their approximate solution. We consider multiparticle effective field methods, effective medium methods, the Mori-Tanaka method, differential methods and some others. This review article tends to concentrate on methods and concepts, their possible generalizations, and connections of different methods, rather than explicit results. In the framework of a unique scheme, we undertake an attempt to analyze the wide class of statical and dynamical, local and nonlocal, linear and nonlinear micromechanical problems of composite materials with deterministic (periodic and non-periodic) and random (statistically homogeneous and inhomogeneous, so-called graded) structures, containing coated or uncoated inclusions of any shape and orientation and subjected to coupled or uncoupled, homogeneous or inhomogeneous, external fields of different physical natures.

This phenomenon, which is referred to as scattering of the electromagnetic wave, explains why the sky is blue. While nonionizing electromagnetic waves such as visible light and infrared radiation mainly undergo elastic scattering (in which the wavelength of the scattered radiation does not change), scattered ionizing radiations undergo a change in wavelength (inelastic scattering). Both types of scattering may have a role in the daily practice of anesthesia and intensive care medicine. For example, the elastic scattering of infrared radiation is one of the principles on which near-infrared spectroscopy ({NIRS}) cerebral oximetry is based and, at the same time, represents a major technological challenge which accounts for some limitations of this technique. Moreover, the special kind of (inelastic) scattering which ionizing radiations undergo (Compton scattering) has a key role in radiation protection. Finally, although nonionizing electromagnetic waves mainly undergo elastic scattering, inelastic scattering may also occur: this phenomenon, which is known as Raman scattering, is used in some types of respiratory gas analyzers.},

This work addresses these problems by adapting and testing a technique for measuring the absolute attenuation and the absolute backscatter coefficient (effective backscatter cross section per unit volume of material), as a function of frequency, in a single-transducer backscatter configuration. The frequency-dependent attenuation and backscatter coefficients of a tissue-mimicking gelatin phantom containing a random distribution of two populations of scatterers were measured, Three transducers with different center frequencies and focusing characteristics were used in order to verify that system-dependent effects were removed by the technique and to investigate the change in the measured parameters across a broad range of frequencies (2 to 60 {MHz}). A spherical autocorrelation model was applied to measurements of the backscatter coefficient in order to estimate the size of scatterers. Measurements demonstrate that the backscatter and attenuation properties of a mixture of two distinct intermixed scatterer-size populations change as a function of the frequency range across which the model is applied. Comparison of both the magnitude and the frequency dependence of the experimental results with the theoretical prediction of the backscatter coefficient showed good agreement.},

The analysis is based on an effective field approach, and uses suitable pair-correlation functions to account for the essential features of densely distributed particles. The effective medium that is equivalent to the original suspension of particles is a medium with space and time dispersion, and hence, its parameters are functions of the frequency of the incident acoustic wave. Under the quasi-crystalline approximation, novel expressions are presented for effective constitutive parameters, which are valid at any frequency and wavelength. The emerging possibility of designing fluid–particle mixtures to form acoustic metamaterials is discussed. Our theory provides a convenient tool for testing ideas in silico in the search for new metamaterials with specific desired properties. An important conclusion of the proposed approach is that negative constitutive parameters can also be achieved by using suspensions of particles with random microstructures with properties similar to those shown in periodic arrays of microstructures.},

	abstract = {The acoustic field reflected from a region containing spherical scatterers is most often estimated by use of the coherent field; that is, the field resulting from the summed scattered fields from the scatterers, averaged over all possible configurations of scatterer locations. It is this ensemble-averaged coherent field which is equivalent to the field reflected from a homogeneous medium with properties which can be derived mathematically using ensemble-averaging techniques. Such properties include the effective density, and the effective wavenumber, which can be derived from multiple scattering theories, or by other homogenisation methods. Experimentally, although ensemble-averaging can be effected in practice in fluid systems due to the motion of the scatterers during the measurement time-scale, measurements in solid materials have fixed locations of scatterers. Averaging can only be achieved by using "large" sample areas, multiple samples or measurements in different locations, or "large" receiver areas. However, in the context of {NDE} applications we are interested in the field resulting from a specific region of material, rather than the average over a large region. Our study addresses the question of when the coherent field (resulting from averaging over many scatterer configurations) can be used as an accurate description of the field reflected by a region of scatterers at fixed locations. In this paper we present results of simulations of the scattered reflected field from a region of solid material containing spherical cavities. Simulations of single realisations of scatterer locations are compared with the coherent field, to demonstrate the validity or otherwise of the use of the coherent field to describe the response of a particular configuration of scatterers.},

To understand the phenomena, a multiple scattering theory, valid for all frequencies, has been developed for scalar {SH} waves reflected by an infinitely large number of uni-directional fibres enclosed in a slab region of an infinitely large body of matrix material. In view of the randomness in position of the fibres in a cross-section, the theory, correct to the order ofc2, wherecis the concentration of the fibres, ignores correlation in the positions of the fibres. Both coherent and incoherent scatterings are considered. A numerical example shows that resonance phenomena begin to appear at about the order of 0.1 {MHz}.},

A quantitative description of the size of these inclusions is critical for both interpreting and modeling the electromagnetic properties of sea ice. Photomicrographs of ice thin sections were analyzed using a personal computer-based image-processing system to determine the number of inclusions, the inclusion size distributions, and statistics for brine pockets in young ice and first-year ice and for air bubbles in a multiyear hummock. Inclusions ranging in size from thousandths of square millimeters to a few square millimeters were measured. In all cases a two-parameter lognormal distribution fits the cumulative inclusion size distributions well (correlation coefficient greater than 0.99). This includes brine pockets in both granular and columnar ice and a range of brine volumes from 2\% to 40\%. As ice warms, and its brine volume increases, the size distribution shifts toward larger brine pockets. This increase in brine pocket size is particularly pronounced for brine volumes greater than 10\% as individual brine pockets coalesce. Air bubbles are much larger than brine pockets, with mean major axis lengths of the order of millimeters for air bubbles and tenths of a millimeter for brine pockets. Observations of inclusion shape factors indicate that, in general, brine pockets are more elongated than air bubbles.},

Specifically, we discuss the analytical method for computing orientationally-averaged light-scattering characteristics for ensembles of nonspherical particles, the methods for overcoming the numerical instability in calculating the T matrix for single nonspherical particles with large size parameters and/or extreme geometries, and the superposition approach for computing light scattering by composite/aggregated particles. Our discussion is accompanied by multiple numerical examples demonstrating the capabilities of the T-matrix approach and showing effects of nonsphericity of simple convex particles (spheroids) on light scattering.},

	abstract = {Dense media radiative transfer ({DMRT}) equations based on quasicrystalline approximation ({QCA}) for densely distributed moderate size particles are developed. We first compute the effective propagation constant and coherent transmission into a dense medium on the basis of the generalized Lorentz-Lorenz law and the generalized Ewald-Oseen extinction theorem. The absorption coefficient of the dense media is then calculated. The distorted Born approximation is next applied to a thin layer to determine the bistatic scattering coefficients and the scattering coefficient. The phase matrix in {DMRT} is then obtained as bistatic scattering coefficient per unit volume. The model is applied to multiple sizes and for sticky particles. Numerical results are illustrated for extinction and brightness temperatures in passive remote sensing using typical parameters in snow terrain. The {QCA}-based {DMRT} is also used to compare with satellite Special Sensor Microwave Imager ({SSM}/I) brightness temperatures for four channels at 19 and 37 {GHz} with vertical and horizontal polarizations and for two snow seasons. It shows reasonable agreement to snow depth of 1 m.},

Comparing the results of different snow models, when driven with the same set of input parameters, can benefit remote sensing of snow. Microwave brightness temperatures of snow at 19 and 37 {GHz} for six different classes of snow (prairie, tundra, taiga, alpine, maritime, and ephemeral) are simulated by means of four different electromagnetic models: the Helsinki University of Technology snow emission model, the microwave emission model of layered snowpacks, a dense-medium radiative-transfer theory model, and a strong fluctuation theory model. The frequency behavior of the extinction coefficients obtained with the different models between 5 and 90 {GHz} is also studied. The four models are also driven with inputs derived from snow-pit data, and the outputs are compared with ground-based measurements of brightness temperatures at 18.7 and 36.5 {GHz}. Significant differences among the brightness temperatures and the extinction coefficients simulated with the four models in the cases of the six classes of snow are observed. Moreover, no particular model is found to be able to systematically reproduce all of the experimental data. The results highlight the need to more closely examine the relationships relating mean grain size and correlation length, introduce multiple layers in each model, and to perform controlled laboratory measurements on materials with well-known electromagnetic properties in order to improve the understanding of the causes of the observed differences and to improve model performance},

	abstract = {For several decades the propagation characteristics of acoustic pulses (attenuation and sound speed) have been inverted in attempts to measure the size distributions of gas bubbles in liquids. While this has biomedical and industrial applications, most notably it has been attempted in the ocean for defence and environmental purposes, where the bubbles are predominantly generated by breaking waves. Such inversions have required assumptions, and the state–of–the–art technique still assumes that the bubbles undergo linear, steady–state monochromatic pulsations in the free field, without interacting. The measurements always violate, to a greater or lesser extent, these assumptions. The errors incurred by the use of such assumptions have been difficult to quantify, but are expected to be most severe underneath breakers in the surf zone, where the void fraction is greatest. Very few measurements have been made in this important region of the ocean. This paper provides a method by which attenuation can be predicted through clouds of bubbles which need not be homogeneous, nor restricted to linear steady–state monochromatic pulsations. To allow inversion of measured surf zone attenuations to estimate bubble populations with current computational facilities, this model is simplified such that the bubble cloud is assumed to be homogeneous and the bubbles oscillating in steady state (although still nonlinearly). The uses of the new methods for assessing the errors introduced in using state–of–the–art inversions are discussed, as are their implications for oceanographic and industrial nonlinear bubble counters, for biomedical contrast agents, and for sonar target detection in the surf zone.},

	shorttitle = {Coherent acoustic response of a screen containing a random distribution of scatterers},
	abstract = {Theoretical models underlying the ultrasonic study of suspensions and bubble swarms in liquids often rely on the concept of a coherent wave response, within which the given medium is viewed as an effective homogeneous medium. More specifically, the coherent response can be formulated in a straightforward manner via the effective wave number and the effective impedance. These in turn can be expressed through the actual material properties of the given scattering medium. The derivation of the effective wave number and impedance is the issue of a number of different approaches existing in the multiple-scattering theory. The present work deals with a coherent response of acoustic wave impinging on a screen of cylindrical inclusions randomly distributed in a fluid. The reflection and transmission coefficients have been expressed via the effective wave number and impedance that are provided by three different models due to Foldy, Waterman \& Truell, and Linton \& Martin. The obtained expressions have been analyzed with a view to illuminate what is the quantitative difference between those approaches as revealed in the coherent response, and how this difference depends on the basic parameters of the problem such as the frequency, the concentration of scatterers and their contrast relatively to the fluid matrix. Another aspect of this work is to compare the above analytical results with the numerical data. It has been obtained by means of a deterministic computational code which delivers the coherent wave field through averaging the outputs for various samplings of the positions of scatterers. Knowing this numerical benchmark allows us to specify the validity domains for each of the three analytical methods under study.},

The suspensions were prepared by crystallizing octadecane droplets in the emulsion. Then, by using a supercooling effect, measurements were obtained at 20°C with either liquid or solid particles. The particle concentrations were 5 and 4.3\% v/v for the emulsions and suspensions, respectively, and the particles had diameters in the range 0.2–30 μm. Measurements were made of ultrasonic velocity and attenuation in the frequency range 5–96 {MHz}. The results are compared with theoretical predictions using a first-order multiple scattering formalism, including polydispersity in particle size. There are dramatic effects, both theoretically and experimentally, upon freezing the particles, mainly due to the presence of resonances in the suspension. In this system the largest particles in the distribution are those most likely to be undergoing resonance. Thus the ultrasonic properties are highly dependent on the detailed particle size distribution.},

Next we discuss these aspects of the problem which derive from the statistical specification of the microscopic parameters; we examine what information can and cannot be obtained from averaged Green's functions. The central portion of the review concerns methods for calculating the averaged Green's function to successively better approximation, including various self-consistent methods, and higher-order cluster effects.

	abstract = {Speckle, amplitude fluctuations in optical coherence tomography ({OCT}) images, contains information on sub-resolution structural properties of the imaged sample. Speckle statistics could therefore be utilized in the characterization of biological tissues. However, a rigorous theoretical framework relating {OCT} speckle statistics to structural tissue properties has yet to be developed. As a first step, we present a theoretical description of {OCT} speckle, relating the {OCT} amplitude variance to size and organization for samples of discrete random media ({DRM}). Starting the calculations from the size and organization of the scattering particles, we analytically find expressions for the {OCT} amplitude mean, amplitude variance, the backscattering coefficient and the scattering coefficient.

However, in many applications, one is not so much interested in making a deterministic image as in detecting changes in the medium. Cases in point are volcano monitoring and measuring the change in hydrocarbon reservoirs during enhanced recovery operations. Coda wave interferometry is a technique wherein changes in multiple-scattered waves are used as a diagnostic for minute changes in the medium. This technique was developed previously for scalar waves; however, the application of this technique in geophysics, nondestructive testing, and other applications where elastic waves are used, requires the extension of the existing formulation of coda wave interferometry to include conversions between P and S waves. Here, a simple model for the equilibration between P and S waves incorporates into the theory of coda wave interferometry the mode conversions that are inherent to multiply scattered elastic waves.},

Coda wave interferometry is a technique that exploits this sensitivity to estimate slight changes in the medium from a comparison of the coda waves before and after the perturbation. For spatially localized changes in the velocity, or for changes in the source location, the travel-time perturbation may be different for different scattering paths. The coda waves that arrive within a certain time window are therefore subject to a distribution of travel-time perturbations. Here I present the general theory of coda wave interferometry, and show how the time-shifted correlation coefficient can be used to estimate the mean and variance of the distribution of travel-time perturbations. I show how this general theory can be used to estimate changes in the wave velocity, in the location of scatterer positions, and in the source location.},

It is assumed that the size distribution of the suspended sediment does not change significantly along the sound path. A newly found explicit solution to acoustic backscatter equation is derived. This explicit solution reduces the computation time significantly during the inversion process. The near-field effect can be included in the inverted quantities by calculating the initial condition with the far-field acoustic backscatter equation and under the assumption of uniform near-field concentration. This method proved successful in the laboratory with initial concentrations of sand up to 3.5 g/L. The errors in estimation of concentration that result from errors in the attenuation coefficients or near-field concentration are significantly amplified with range in a uniform concentration field. However, with an exponential concentration profile, which is commonly found in sediment suspension phenomena, the inversion is only weakly sensitive to attenuation coefficients associated with sound absorption by water and sound scattering by suspended particles. Near-field concentration errors result in commensurate errors throughout the range in the exponential profile.},

The latter is a solver based on numerical Monte Carlo integration of the ladder and cyclical diagrams appearing in the microphysical theory of radiative transfer and coherent backscattering ({RT}-{CB}). The quantitative agreement between the {STMM} and {RT}-{CB} computations provides verification of the {RT}-{CB} theory. Prominent backscattering features exhibited by the {STMM} data cannot be reproduced by keeping only the ladder diagrams of {RT}.

An analysis is presented of the spectral dependence of the light collected in spectroscopic {OCT} for samples comprised of spherical particles. Many factors are considered including the effects of scatterer size, interference between the fields scattered from closely adjacent scatterers, and the numerical aperture of the {OCT} system. The modulation of the spectrum of the incident light by scattering of a plane wave from a single sphere is a good indicator of particle size and composition. However, it is shown in this work that the sharp focusing of fields causes the spectral signature to shift and the presence of multiple scatterers has dramatic modulation effects on the spectra.

	abstract = {We discuss the theoretical basis of a recently developed technique to characterize aerosols from space. We show that the interaction between aerosols and the strong molecular scattering in the near ultraviolet produces spectral variations of the backscattered radiances that can be used to separate aerosol absorption from scattering effects. This capability allows identification of several aerosol types, ranging from nonabsorbing sulfates to highly {UV}-absorbing mineral dust, over both land and water surfaces. Two ways of using the information contained in the near-{UV} radiances are discussed. In the first method, a residual quantity, which measures the departure of the observed spectral contrast from that of a molecular atmosphere, is computed. Since clouds yield nearly zero residues, this method is a useful way of separately mapping the spatial distribution of {UV}-absorbing and nonabsorbing particles. To convert the residue to optical depth, the aerosol type must be known. The second method is an inversion procedure that uses forward calculations of backscattered radiances for an ensemble of aerosol models. Using a look-up table approach, a set of measurements given by the ratio of backscattered radiance at 340–380 nm and the 380 nm radiance are associated, within the domain of the candidate aerosol models, to values of optical depth and single-scattering albedo. No previous knowledge of aerosol type is required. We present a sensitivity analysis of various error sources contributing to the estimation of aerosol properties by the two methods.},
