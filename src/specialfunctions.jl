    transmission_direction(k_eff::Complex, incident_wavevector::AbstractArray, surface_normal::AbstractArray)

Gives the effective direction `direction` where `sum(x^2 for x in direction) = 1.0` and the components of `k_eff .* direction` and `incident_wavevector` which are orthogonal to the surface are the same. Note `surface_normal` is the outward pointing normal and the incident medium's wavenumber `k = sqrt(sum(incident_wavevector .^2))`. Below we deduce the result.

Assume that `dot(v,w) = conj(v[i])w[i]` and `surface_normal[i]*surface_normal[i] = 1`. Let `wnp` be orthogonal to `surface_normal`

    wnp =  incident_wavevector -  dot(surface_normal,incident_wavevector) .* surface_normal

Then we know that the effective transmission wavevector has to equal

    k_eff_vec = wnp + α .* surface_normal

where α is determined so that

    sum(x^2 for x in wnp) + α^2  = sum(x^2 for x in k_eff_vec) = k_eff^2

    transmission_angle(wavevector::StaticVector{3}, surface_normal::StaticVector{3})

Some care is needed hear when `wavevector` is a complex vector in 3 dimensions.

## The maths

Let's define the normal projection `vn`:

    n = - surface_normal
    vn = dot(n,wavevector) .* n

remembering that in Julia, and mathematics, `dot(v,w) = sum(conj(v[i])*w[i] for i in eachindex(v))`.

We now define the orthogonal component `vo` and its direction `no`:

    vo = wavevector - vn
    no = vo / sqrt(sum(vo.^2))

Note this assumes that `vo` is a real vector, which it should be due to symmetry.

To determine the transmission angle `θT` we calculate the wavenumber

    k = ± sqrt(sum(wavevector .^2))

where we choose the sign in `±` such that `imag(k) >= 0`.

From the above we can write the `wavevector` in the form

    wavevector = k .* (n .* cos(θ) + no .* sin(θ))

which implies that

    k * cos(θ) = dot(conj(n), wavevector)
    k * sin(θ) = dot(conj(no),wavevector) = dot(conj(no),vo) = sqrt(sum(vo.^2))

From these two we can robustly calculate `θT` as

    θT = atan(sqrt(sum(vo.^2)),dot(n,wavevector))
