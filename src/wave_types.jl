    EffectivePlaneWaveMode{T<:AbstractFloat,Dim} <: AbstractWaveMode{T,Dim}

Is a struct that represents a mode of the average scattering coefficients for plane wave symmetry. That is, when using an incident plane wave and a plate or halfspace for the material geometry.

This wave mode has frequency ``\\omega`` and has has the value ``A e^{i k \\mathbf v \\cdot \\mathbf x }`` at the point ``\\mathbf x``, where ``A`` are the amplitudes, ``\\mathbf v`` is the direction and ``k`` is the effective wavenumber. We represent these quantities as

  * ``\\omega = `` `EffectivePlaneWaveMode.ω`
  * ``k = `` `EffectivePlaneWaveMode.wavenumber`
  * ``v = `` `EffectivePlaneWaveMode.direction`
  * ``A = `` `EffectivePlaneWaveMode.amplitudes`
  * ``M = `` `EffectivePlaneWaveMode.basis_order`

To recover the average scattering coefficients ``F`` from a particle use:

``F_{ns} = i^m A_{n s} e^{-i n  θ} ``

where ``n`` is multi-index for 3 dimensions and ``s`` ranges from 1 to the number of species.

In 2D, inconvieniently, an extra factor of ``e^{i k \\mathbf v \\cdot \\mathbf x}`` needs to be multiplied on the right of the above equation where `θ` is calculated from [`transmission_angle`](@ref).

``\\mathrm v_{n_1}(\\mathbf r) = \\mathrm j_{\\ell_1} (k r) \\mathrm Y_{\\ell_1 m_1}(\\hat{\\mathbf r})``

and ``\\mathrm Y_{\\ell_1 m_1}`` is a spherical harmonic, ``n_1 = (\\ell_1,m_1)`` where we always have that ``\\ell_1 \\geq 0`` and ``\ell_1 \\geq |m_1|`` according to the conventions of [spherical harmonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics).
