## [demo.jl](vary_two_species/README.md)
Shows how to choose two species, vary the volume fraction of them both, and plot the resulting sound speed and attenuation.

## [Demonstrate the matching method](matched_method/README.md)
Compare the matched method with a purely numerical scheme. Both of these methods calculate the ensemble average wave in a particulate material.
